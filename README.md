COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

Welcome! I'm thrilled to share my work with you. In this project, I utilized publicly available data from the Our World in Data repository to analyze the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to explore and analyze real-world datasets using SQL.

Project Overview

This project focuses on uncovering insights about the COVID-19 pandemic through exploratory data analysis. By writing and executing a series of SQL queries, I analyzed key aspects of the data to answer meaningful questions and extract actionable insights. Below are the main objectives and findings of this project:

Key Objectives
Mortality Analysis: Calculate the likelihood of death from COVID-19 in each country based on reported cases and fatalities.
Global Mortality Rate: Determine the percentage of deaths worldwide in relation to confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Vaccination Progress: Measure how many people have been vaccinated globally and analyze vaccination rates across different countries.
Skills Demonstrated
Data Exploration: Wrote advanced SQL queries to extract, clean, and analyze the dataset.
Data Visualization: Used SQL and other tools to identify trends and present key metrics effectively.
Problem-Solving: Addressed questions about global health trends and vaccination rates using data-driven approaches.
Dataset
The data used in this project is sourced from the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset, which provides comprehensive and up-to-date information on cases, deaths, testing, and vaccinations worldwide. The dataset is publicly available and widely recognized for its reliability and accuracy.

Key Insights

Identified countries with the highest and lowest likelihood of COVID-19 fatalities.
Calculated the global COVID-19 mortality rate, providing insight into the pandemic's impact.
Analyzed vaccination trends, highlighting countries with the fastest and slowest vaccination rollouts.
How to Use This Repository

The repository contains all the SQL queries I wrote for this project. Each query is designed to address a specific question or objective, allowing you to replicate and explore the analysis for yourself.

This project showcases the power of data analysis in understanding and responding to global challenges. By analyzing the COVID-19 dataset, I was able to uncover key trends and patterns that provide valuable insights into the pandemic's impact and vaccination efforts worldwide.

Feel free to explore the queries, share your feedback, or reach out with any questions!
